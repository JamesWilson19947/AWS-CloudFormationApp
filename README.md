# What is this?
As part of my learning of Terraform, Cloud Formation, ECS and CI/CD I created a very simple application which just shows pictures of different Shiba Dogs.
The backend of the application is done in PHP which calls the https://shibe.online/ API which returns a photo of a shiba dog. The application is not designed to be state of art or fancy in anyway, its merely a test bed so I can learn infrastructre coding.
